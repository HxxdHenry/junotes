Context for Continuing:

Project Overview:

Goal: To create a website for uploading and accessing college notes and assignments.
Current Status: We have a dynamic dropdown system for selecting stream, year, subject, and type, and are able to navigate to the notes.html page based on the selected options.
Current Code and Setup:

HTML Files:
index.html: The main page with dropdowns for selecting stream, year, subject, and type.
notes.html: The page where users will access notes or assignments based on their selections.
CSS File:
styles.css: Contains styling for the website.
JavaScript File:
script.js: Manages the dynamic dropdown functionality and page navigation.
Desired Functionality for notes.html:

Dropdowns: To list and select available notes or assignments.
Fetching Files: The ability to fetch files from a Telegram channel (for free storage).
Download Option: Files should be downloadable directly from the website.
Dynamic Viewer: To display the contents of the files (e.g., PDF viewer, image viewer).
Technical Details:

Document Structure:
btech-cse/1/mathematics/notes.html
File Storage: Using Telegram channel links for storing and accessing files.
Specific Requests:

Implement a dynamic viewer for files (PDFs, images, etc.).
Ensure files are downloadable without revealing Telegram channel links.
Connect notes.html properly with the dropdown selections from index.html.
